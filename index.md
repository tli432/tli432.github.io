## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the MIT Sloan School of Management, working with Prof. [Swati Gupta](https://swatigupta.tech/). 

I obtained my PhD in Operations Research from Georgia Tech ISyE in Summer 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Guanghui (George) Lan](https://sites.gatech.edu/guanghui-lan/) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/). I also got an M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance from the same institute. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Fudan University.


## Research Interests

My research focuses on the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for *Nonlinear Optimization*, *Stochastic Optimization*, and *Dynamic Decision*-*Making*. I am particularly interested in

- **Parameter-free methods for convex and nonconvex optimization** 
- **Stochastic optimization for statistical learning and machine learning**
- **Policy optimization and policy evaluation for Markov decision processes** 
- **Applications:** healthcare, E-commerce, finance, etc

**PhD Dissertation: [New Accelerated Methods for Optimization and Reinforcement Learning](https://hdl.handle.net/1853/78712)**
