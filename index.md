## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/), working with Prof. [Swati Gupta](https://swatigupta.tech/). 

I obtained my PhD in Operations Research from [Georgia Tech ISyE](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/) in Summer 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Guanghui (George) Lan](https://sites.gatech.edu/guanghui-lan/) and Prof. [Ashwin Pananjady](https://sites.gatech.edu/ashwin-pananjady/). I also got an M.S. in Quantitative and Computational Finance from the same institute. Before that, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).


## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the theory and methodology of *Nonlinear Optimization*, *Stochastic Optimization*, and *Dynamic Decision*-*Making*, with a central focus on bridging rigorous theoretical development with practical relevance, especially in data science and artificial intelligence.
I am particularly interested in

- **Parameter-free methods for large-scale convex and nonconvex optimization** 
- **Stochastic optimization for statistical learning and machine learning**
- **Policy optimization and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning** 
- **Applications: AI for healthcare, E-commerce, finance, etc.**

**PhD Dissertation: [New Accelerated Methods for Optimization and Reinforcement Learning](https://hdl.handle.net/1853/78712), Aug 2025**
